<h1>GROWTH HUB – MEETING SCRIPT (Dan Williams)</h1>
<p style="opacity:0.7;">A calm, structured run-through for the Teams board meeting.</p>

<hr>

<h2>1. Opening Line</h2>
<div class="section">
    <p class="line">“Good morning, and thank you for your time.  
    I’m Dan Williams from Dursley.  
    I’ve built a set of practical tools over the last few weeks that help with  
    <span class='highlight'>revenue clarity, battery stability, and data handling</span> — all running on low-cost hardware.”</p>
</div>

<h2>2. What I’m Actually Proposing (The 3 Pillars)</h2>
<div class="section">
    <p class="line"><span class="highlight">Pillar 1 – Revenue & Data Truth</span><br>
    Tools that give small businesses simple projections, churn modelling, and capacity planning.  
    No jargon — just clean, honest numbers.</p>

    <p class="line"><span class="highlight">Pillar 2 – Battery & Hardware Lab</span><br>
    A small, realistic test space to explore vibration, thermal load and stability features.  
    Goal: +10% battery life improvements through smarter design, not magic.</p>

    <p class="line"><span class="highlight">Pillar 3 – Compression & System Layer</span><br>
    Tools that shrink data while preserving structure — useful for archives, sensors, museums, labs.”</p>
</div>

<h2>3. Why Only These 3?</h2>
<div class="section">
    <p class="line">“You’ll see five pillars in the full pack — that’s the full long-term horizon.  
    For <span class='highlight'>Phase 1, I’m only asking you to consider these three</span>.  
    The education and heritage pillars come later *once the core is stable, funded, and delivering value*.”</p>
</div>

<h2>4. What I’m Asking the Board</h2>
<div class="section">
    <p class="line">“I’m looking for guidance on the best structure —  
    sole trader, CIC, or startup — and support connecting with:  
    schools, Uni of Bristol, local museums, and businesses.</p>

    <p class="line">I’d also like help shaping a <span class='highlight'>pilot lab</span> —  
    something small, affordable, and deliverable within months.”</p>
</div>

<h2>5. What Makes This Useful Locally</h2>
<div class="section">
    <p class="line">“Everything I’m building runs on cheap devices —  
    phones, Raspberry Pi, school laptops.  
    It’s a low-cost way to bring coding, physics, and problem-solving  
    back into Dursley, Cam and Berkeley.</p>

    <p class="line">My goal is to keep this work <span class='highlight'>rooted locally</span>  
    so the benefits — skills, jobs, inspiration — stay in the district.”</p>
</div>

<h2>6. Closing Line</h2>
<div class="section">
    <p class="line">“That’s the overview. I’m happy to walk through the demo or  
    answer any questions. Thank you again for the opportunity.”</p>
</div>
