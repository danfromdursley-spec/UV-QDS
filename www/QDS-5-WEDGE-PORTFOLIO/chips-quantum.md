# Semiconductor & Quantum Noise
Deep-tech credibility wedge.
Focus: mapping QDS kernel parameters to correlated jitter/crosstalk/decoherence models.

Deliverables:
- simple toy models
- measurement prompts (SQUID/NV-style framing)
- reproducible logs

Scope boundaries:
- physics-informed modelling
- no claims of replacing established device models
