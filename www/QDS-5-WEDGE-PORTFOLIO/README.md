# QDS 5-Wedge Portfolio 🎩
A focused, stand-alone investment + engineering bundle for the Quantum Dark Substrate (QDS) ecosystem.

This is the clean funding spine for QDS:
1) Energy / Batteries  
2) Semiconductor & Quantum noise modelling  
3) Compression / Signals  
4) Sensors / Metrology (LifeFirst)  
5) Reproducibility OS + Field Test Pack  

What this repo is:
- wedge-first deployment pack
- concise claims + scope boundaries
- reusable kernel parameter framing
- reproducible, phone-safe demos

What this repo is not:
- not the full theory archive
- not a claim of completed product readiness

Unifying thesis:
A finite, causal correlation kernel underpins:
- stability improvements (energy + hardware)
- correlated-noise prediction (chips + quantum)
- structure-preserving compression (signals)
- portable validation workflows (OS + field kit)
