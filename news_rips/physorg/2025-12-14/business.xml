                <description>A comprehensive analysis of 383 U.S. cities reveals a striking pattern: most have rings of isolation in suburban areas and segregated pockets near the urban core, that are shaped by race, wealth, and proximity to downtown, finds a new study by UCL researchers.</description>

                <title>Subnational income inequality revealed: Regional successes may hold key to addressing widening gap globally</title>
                <description>Income inequality is one of the most important measures of economic health, social justice and quality of life. More reliably trackable than wealth inequality, which was recently given a gloomy report card by the G20, income inequality is particularly relevant to immediate economic relief, mobility and people&#039;s everyday standard of living.</description>

                <description>A naturally fluffy white beard, a round belly and a jolly laugh might seem like the keys to being a successful Santa Claus, but new research suggests that a calling to play the man with the bag full of toys is enough to help candidates overcome a lack of typical attributes for the role.</description>

                <description>A technical glitch during a Zoom call shouldn&#039;t be that big a deal, or lead someone to make a judgment about the person on the other end. But in actuality, glitches during face-to-face video calls—even when the glitch does not affect the transmission of information—can shatter the illusion of being across the table from the other person, evoking a creepy or eerie feeling known as &quot;uncanniness.&quot;</description>

                <description>When UC Berkeley biochemist Jennifer Doudna first began studying how bacteria fight virus infections, she had no idea it would result in one of the most important scientific breakthroughs of the century. Her curiosity-driven research on an obscure bacterial immune system called CRISPR eventually led to a revolutionary gene-editing tool—and earned her the 2020 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.</description>

This area contains traces of every cultural phase of southeast Arabia&#039;s history, covering a period from about 2500 BC through possibly the fourth century AD.</description>

                <description>An organization drafts a job listing with artificial intelligence. Droves of applicants conjure résumés and cover letters with chatbots. Another AI system sifts through those applications, passing recommendations to hiring managers. Perhaps AI avatars conduct screening interviews. This is increasingly the state of hiring, as people seek to streamline the stressful, tedious process with AI.</description>

                <description>What makes us tip? A new study explores two main motives: genuine appreciation for the service and conformity with social norms. Those who truly value the service tend to tip above the standard rate, while conformists usually align with them—leading to a gradual rise in average tipping rates over time.</description>

As free-text questions, they require not only specialist knowledge but also the ability to think and argue economically. However, grading these answers is a time-consuming task for university assistants: Each answer must be checked and assessed individually.</description>

                <title>Testosterone doesn&#039;t affect men&#039;s economic decisions, large study shows</title>
                <description>Testosterone has long been linked to risk-taking, generosity, and competitiveness. But a new large-scale study—the biggest of its kind—finds that men given testosterone made the same economic choices as those given a placebo. The study, led by researchers at the Stockholm School of Economics in Sweden and Nipissing University in Canada, examined things like men&#039;s inclination to take risk, act fairly or compete with others.</description>

                <title>Women portrayed as younger than men online, and AI amplifies the bias</title>
                <description>U.S. Census data shows no systematic age differences between men and women in the workforce over the past decade. And globally, women on average live about five years longer than men. But that&#039;s not what you&#039;ll see if you search Google or YouTube or query an AI like ChatGPT.</description>

                <title>Overconfidence persists even where regular feedback should discourage it, chess study finds</title>
                <description>The late psychologist Daniel Kahneman once said if he could wave a magic wand and get rid of any bias, he would choose overconfidence. However, overconfidence is here to stay. In a recent study in Psychological Science, researchers examined this bias among tournament chess players, to investigate if overconfidence is prevalent in an environment that should discourage it.</description>

                <title>AI tool visually maps science funding and its real-world impacts</title>
                <description>The impact of scientific research extends far beyond the laboratory. Breakthroughs like insulin and innovations like the internet have transformed our everyday lives. They also influence policymaking and the overall economy. To make the most of every discovery, we must understand how science and its funding ripple through society, but how do we trace that impact?</description>
