                <title>Freezing salty water reveals dynamic brine migration and evolving ice patterns</title>
                <description>Imagine holding a narrow tube filled with salty water and watching it begin to freeze from one end. You might expect the ice to advance steadily and push the salt aside in a simple and predictable way. Yet the scene that unfolded was unexpectedly vivid.</description>

                <description>The electrochemical CO2 (carbon dioxide) reduction reaction takes harmful pollutants and transforms them into valuable products like fuel. However, selectively tailoring various processes in this reaction to successfully and efficiently arrive at a particular desired outcome remains a challenge.</description>

                <description>The perception of a chemist varies. Some might imagine the &quot;mad scientist&quot; from old cartoons—a white-haired older man working with beakers in his lab—but as that cliche fades, the reality of what constitutes a chemist&#039;s job might likewise need an update.</description>

                <title>Enhancing machine-learning interatomic potentials for advanced materials modeling</title>
                <description>Machine learning is transforming many scientific fields, including computational materials science. For about two decades, scientists have been using it to make accurate yet inexpensive calculations of interatomic potentials, that are mathematical functions that express the energy of a system of atoms and are an ingredient to simulate and predict the stability and properties of materials. But machine learning by itself is not a magic wand, and many problems remain.</description>

                <description>Biphenomycins, natural products derived from bacteria, show excellent antimicrobial activity, but have long remained out of reach for drug development. The main obstacle was the limited understanding of how these compounds are produced by their microbial hosts.</description>

                <description> New psychoactive substances, originally developed as potential analgesics but abandoned due to adverse side effects, may still have pharmaceutical value if researchers could nail down the causes of those side effects. A new study from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign used deep learning and large-scale computer simulations to identify structural differences in synthetic cannabinoid molecules that cause them to bind to human brain receptors differently from classical cannabinoids.</description>

                <description>Supramolecular chemistry involves the study of self-assembly of discrete molecules that are used to build large functional structures. Often, these molecules are allowed to self-assemble into one-dimensional polymeric structures (supramolecular polymers or SPs) in a suitable environment, and the dynamic molecular interactions are noted for tweaking the environment and improving the features of the resulting SPs. They are being explored as the next-generation polymeric materials with applications in electronics, soft-robotics, nanofabrication, and biomedical fields.</description>

                <description>Researchers at Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg (MLU) have developed a promising new substance for targeting bacteria that cause tuberculosis. The team have produced a compound that inhibits the pathogens&#039; ability to produce energy and causes them to die. Established drugs work in a similar fashion, but the pathogen is becoming increasingly resistant to these medications. The study was conducted jointly with other researchers from Germany, the USA and Canada and its findings were published in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry.</description>

                <title>Free radicals caught in the act with slow spectroscopy</title>
                <description>Why does plastic turn brittle and paint fade when exposed to the sun for long periods? Scientists have long known that such organic photodegradation occurs due to the sun&#039;s energy generating free radicals: molecules that have lost an electron to sunlight-induced ionization and have been left with an unpaired one, making them very eager to react with other molecules in the environment. However, the exact mechanisms for how and why the energy from the sun&#039;s photons get stored and released in the materials over very long periods have eluded empirical evidence.</description>

                <title>Seeing inside smart gels: Scientists capture dynamic behavior under stress</title>
                <description>Advances in materials science have led to the development of &quot;smart materials,&quot; whose properties do not remain static but change in response to external stimuli. One such material is poly(N-isopropylacrylamide), or PNIPAM, a polymer gel that alters its solubility with temperature. The polymer contains hydrophilic amide groups and hydrophobic isopropyl groups.</description>

                <title>Fullerenes could improve MRI clarity by enabling more efficient dynamic nuclear polarization</title>
                <description>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is invaluable in the medical world. But despite all the good it does, there is room for improvement. One way to enhance the sensitivity of MRI is dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP), where target molecules for imaging are modified so they form clearer images when scanned with an MRI machine. But this technique requires special crystalline materials mixed with polarizing agents that are difficult to create.</description>
